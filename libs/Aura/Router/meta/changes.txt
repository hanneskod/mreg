- Add metadata files

- Fix a bug in Route::isSecureMatch(), and add logging/debugging tools; thanks, HariKT, for the report that led to this commit.
    
    - [ADD] Property Map::$log
    
    - [ADD] Method Map::logRoute() to add routes to the log
    
    - [ADD] Method Map::getLog() to get the log of routes tried
    
    - [CHG] Method Map::match() to log each route tried
    
    - [ADD] Property Route::$debug to track why the route did not match
    
    - [CHG] Throughout Route methods, add debug information when a route does
      not match.
    
    - [REF] Refactor method Route::isMatch() to extract new method
      Route::isRegexMatch().
    
    - [FIX] Method Route::isSecureMatch() now uses ==, not =, to examine the
      server port value.

- add a test for issue #7
