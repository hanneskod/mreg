- rename Command to AbstractCommand, to keep with naming conventions

- update reference to Command.php to AbstractCommand.php in src.php

- Fix some of the examples in Readme, create an instance script, remove
  unwanted files in src.php

- fix src.php to include the right files

- the Context object now takes one param at construction time, an array of
  globals. This puts it in line with the Aura Web Context object. Also, update
  README with better examples and more information.

- for di config, pass globals
